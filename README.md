# Fake News Detection

## Project Overview

This project is designed to detect fake news using a machine learning model. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify news articles as 'fake' or 'real'. The user-friendly interface created with Gradio allows users to input news text and receive immediate predictions.

## Features

- **Interactive Text Input**: Users can input the text of a news article directly into the web interface.
- **Real-time Prediction**: The system predicts whether the news is likely to be fake or real, displaying results as percentages along with a visual indicator (red cross or green check).

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the LSTM model.
- **Gradio**: For creating an interactive web interface.

## Model Description

The backend model is a LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network that has been trained on a comprehensive dataset of fake and real news articles. This model is capable of understanding the context in the text due to its deep learning capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
